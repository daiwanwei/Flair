## Description of your project (500 words)
Let's live in a "Flair" way! 

By combination of Flexible & Fair, "Flair" is aiming to set up a brand-new standard for the drawing organism in Gaming. By observing the untransparent draw behind games continuously disappoint the gamers, and even most of the on-chain games do the probability calculation outside of chain, we decided to create a solution that can make sure an absolute fairness for each draw, and at the same time being easily applied by the game developers. 

Firstly, Flair's Hierarchical Drawing Pools architecture enables game developers to freely customize pool probabilities for each use case according to their game design while maintaining constant and fair pull rates using on-chain random variables generator, as a verifiable source of randomness to address any fairness concerns. Secondly, the smart contractâ€™s multi-layer design also allows for unlimited minting of common utility cards as well as launching rebalances and expansions without affecting the overall pull rates. Last but not least, base on the nature of blockchain, the result of each draw is totally traceable for the players too. 

In conclusion, Flair plays as a new standard in the next-generation GameFi, which  increases the playability and offers reliability for the game owners.
